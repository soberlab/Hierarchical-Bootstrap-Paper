# Hierarchical-Bootstrap-Paper
This repository contains the code used to perform simulations and obtain plots used in the Hierarchical Boostrap paper in addition to some of the analysis done on the birdsong data.

The Jupyter Notebook titled "Bootstrap Paper Simulation Figure Codes" contains all the code that produced the simulations and figures presented in the "Simulations" section of the Results. In addition, the MATLAB file contains the code that was used to do the bootstrap analysis on the birdsong data.

Note however that while the simulation results can be reproduced entirely from the files provided, the example results can not be since we are not providing the raw data and all of the analysis scripts. These can be made available upon reasonable request.

Additionally, the data for the example involving optogenetic control of behavior in flies came from a collaborator and so that data has not been made available and may be available upon reasonable request.
